# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# got = Show.create(name: "Game of Thrones")
# walking_dead = Show.create(name: "Walking dead")
# gotham = Show.create(name: "Gotham")
#
#
# Season.create(show: got, number: 1, start_date: '2014-06-01', end_date: '2014-08-01')
# Season.create(show: got, number: 2, start_date: '2015-06-01', end_date: '2015-08-01')
# Season.create(show: got, number: 3, start_date: '2016-06-01', end_date: '2016-08-01')

# Season.create(show: gotham, number: 1, start_date: '2015-10-01', end_date: '2015-12-01')
